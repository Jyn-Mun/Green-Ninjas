                <h2>How to get started with Fashion Activism</h2>
                <p> When we’re talking about these massive issues, like the climate crisis or
                    modern-day slavery, it can feel overwhelming. In a similar vein,
                    solving these issues can feel insurmountable, and words like “activist” can feel
                    intimidating. But know that being a fashion activist doesn’t mean
                    that you alone are taking on all of these issues on your
                    shoulders to solve them. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. </p>

                <h2>Six ways loss of Arctic ice impacts everyone</h2>
                <p>Polar ice caps are melting as global warming causes climate change.
                    We lose Arctic sea ice at a rate of almost 13% per decade, and over
                    the past 30 years, the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic has declined
                    by a stunning 95%. If emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic
                    could be ice-free in the summer by 2040. But what happens in the Arctic
                    does not stay in the Arctic. Sea ice loss has far-reaching effects around
                    the world. <a

                <h2>10 Plastic-Free Sunscreens for Your Low Waste Beach Bag</h2>
                <p>As we head into the sunny months of summer,
                    finding a non-greasy, no-white cast sunscreen with at least
                    30 SPF coverage might be your biggest clean beauty priority
                    — and rightfully so! But adding a low waste and plastic-free
                    sunscreen pre-requisite into your checklist might just go a long
                    way in shielding the planet as well. The beauty industry
                    produces an estimated 120 billion units of plastic packaging
                    on an annual basis, most of which are not widely recyclable.
                    Sustainable alternatives include packaging made of aluminum,
                    glass and paper are endlessly recyclable. </p>

                <h2>Should we give up flying for the sake of the climate?</h2>
                <p>Everything we do, from the food we eat, products we buy to the way we travel,
                    releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and so has an impact on the planet’s
                    climate. But some activities have a far greater impact than others.
                    Around 2.4% of global CO2 emissions come from aviation. Together with
                    other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry
                    is responsible for around 5% of global warming. At first glance, that might not seem like
                    very big contribution. Except, only a very small percentage of the world flies frequently.
                    Even in richer countries like the UK and the US, around half of people fly in any given year,
                    and just 12-15% are frequent fliers.</p>

                <h2>How to be a green software engineer</h2>
                <p> As software engineers, we hate solving the same problem over and over again,
                    so we build libraries of code and reuse other libraries as much as possible.
                    This is generally great and very green! But, increasingly, we rely on 3rd party
                    components that are thousands of times larger than the portions we actually want
                    to use. As a result, we ship a product that requires ten times or a hundred times
                    more disk space and memory than if the product was developed completely in-house.
                    Of course, developing completely in-house could mean you’ll never finish the product
                    and is not practical, but like everything else in life, there’s
                    probably a good balance that can be maintained that makes sense for the project. </p>

                <h2>How electric vehicles will shape the future</h2>
                <p>The electric vehicle landscape is rapidly changing as both technology and interest evolve,
                    and the coming years will see many more EVs take to the roads, seas, and skies. In the US,
                    electric vehicles sales have climbed by more than 40 percent a year since 2016. By 2035, the
                    largest automotive markets will be fully electric—providing both a glimpse of a green future
                    and significant economic opportunity. Explore our insights to find out</p>
